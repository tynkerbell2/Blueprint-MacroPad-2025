**And this was the code that took me forever to do, I definitely overcomplicated this part but I must say I am very proud of it. Next project I might even try to incorperate some sort of app that would interface with the micro-controller if possible and say what song is playing or the current volume - right now the volume is just a guess. No clue if any of this code even works, haven't really had the chance to try it.
